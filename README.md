# esx_advert

I was watching a live on an RP server and saw a script like that. I didn't remember seeing one on the forum so I just decided to make it.
Nothing really difficult, /ad [your message] in game to send an advert to every connected players.
Showcase : https://youtu.be/xL3udfCAW0Y
The script is available in english and in french, change the serveren.lua to serverfr.lua in __resource.lua if you want it in french.
Default delay between each message is 20 sec, you can change it in the client.lua
You need esx (https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended), only journalists can use the command, you can just remove this part from the script, else you'll need esx_jobs (https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_jobs)
Do not re-upload this without asking me first please.
